UPMC Hillman Tumor Microenvironment Center (TMC)

The Tumor Microenvironment Center (TMC) brings together preclinical
and clinical scientists with the goal of translating basic knowledge
of the mechanisms of interaction between cancer cells and their
microenvironment, to enhance and accelerate direct patient-oriented
interventions. Included in the microenvironment are the immune,
inflammatory, and patient-specific factors that regulate cancer
development, progression, and response to anti-cancer treatments.
